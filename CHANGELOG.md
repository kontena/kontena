## [1.3.0](https://github.com/kontena/kontena/releases/tag/v1.3.0) (2017-06-09)

### Highlights

This release upgrades the used MongoDB driver to a version which supports newer MongoDB release than 3.0. It essentially means that now there's support for using hosted (e.g. Mongo Atlas) services as Kontena Master database. And naturally, the newer mongoid and underlying db driver boosts the stability of the server.

We've also added support for using Kontena CLI to open an interactive terminals into running service instances. This makes debugging and executing any maintenance scripts a lot easier.

All CLI list commands such as `kontena node list` or `kontena service list` now accept `-q` or `--quiet` parameter for outputting only the identifying column of the list, such as node name or container ID. This makes it easier to pipe the output to other commands. For example: `kontena service ls -q|xargs -n1 kontena service show`.

### Breaking changes

CLI trusted-subnet command has been refactored to match same pattern with other commands to use the current grid automatically. If a user has written some scripts that utilize any of these subcommands, after this change they will simply fail due to `ERROR: too many arguments` and not corrupt any data until the extra grid parameter is removed from said scripts.

`kontena service exec` command has changed the meaning of short `-i` option. Now it means `--interactive`, the new option for executing on specific instance is `--instance`. This change is done to comply with `docker exec -it` options which users are accustomed to use tp get interactive terminals into running containers.

### Deprecations

CLI `kontena app ...` commands have been now deprecated in favor of `kontena stack` commands.

## [1.2.0](https://github.com/kontena/kontena/releases/tag/v1.2.0) (2017-04-21)

### Highlights

#### Experimental volumes support
The Kontena 1.2 release introduces [experimental support for volume management](https://kontena.io/docs/using-kontena/volumes).
Stack services can now [use](https://kontena.io/docs/references/kontena-yml#volumes) volumes created by `kontena volume create`, and the service and volume instances will be scheduled together.

Kontena volumes can use volume drivers provided by Docker plugins installed on the host nodes, such as [rexray](https://rexray.codedellemc.com/).

See the [Upgrading](#upgrading-stacks-with-services-using-named-docker-volumes) section for existing stacks with services using named volumes, which were previously deployed as implicitly created local Docker volumes.

The exact details of how these Kontena volumes are managed may still change as the implementation evolves. If you use the experimental Kontena volumes support, be prepared to change your volume definitions as necessary when upgrading to newer Kontena versions.

#### Native IPsec overlay network encryption

Host nodes will be upgraded to Weave 1.9.3, and switch to using the new IPSec [encrypted datapath](https://kontena.io/docs/core-concepts/networking#encrypted-datapath) for the overlay networking between host nodes.

The new encrypted datapath uses native Linux IPsec encryption, providing improved performance compared to the current [userspace `sleeve`](https://kontena.io/docs/core-concepts/networking#sleeve) transport.
Host nodes will fall back to the current UDP-based `sleeve` transport if they are unable to send or receive IPsec ESP packets. Note that the default firewall rules for e.g. Google Cloud Platform deny IPsec ESP packets by default.

#### Improved service deployment and agent communication

The server and agent have been improved to be more robust in the case of various error and overload situations affecting service deployments.
The agent can now recover from various errors, healing itself and resolving any deployment inconsistencies.

The `kontena service deploy` and `kontena stack` commands now provide better reporting of deployment errors.

#### Support for Kontena Cloud metrics and real-time updates

The Kontena 1.2 release supports additional host/container stats used for the updated [Kontena Cloud](https://cloud.kontena.io) dashboard, as well as realtime streaming of updates as services are deployed or host nodes update. Refer to the [release blog post](https://blog.kontena.io/kontena-1-2-0-release/#kontenacloudupdates) for more details.

#### CLI

* [`kontena shell`](https://github.com/kontena/kontena-plugin-shell#kontena-shell)

    The [Kontena Shell](https://github.com/kontena/kontena-plugin-shell#kontena-shell) is available as an optional plugin for Kontena 1.2, offering an improved interactive console interface: `kontena plugin install shell`

* [`kontena grid create --subnet --supernet`](https://kontena.io/docs/using-kontena/grids#grid-subnet-supernet)

    If the default `10.80.0.0/12` internal overlay network address space overlaps with the the private networking address space on the host node provider, you can chose a different internal overlay networking address space for use by the Kontena host nodes and service containers.

* [`kontena grid update --log-forwarder fluentd`](https://kontena.io/docs/using-kontena/grids#logging-options)

    The agent can ship service container logs to an external `fluentd` server.

* `kontena grid events`, `kontena stack events`, `kontena service events`

    Follow scheduling and deployment related-events across the Kontena master and node agents.

* `kontena stack {build,install,upgrade,validate} --values-to --values-from`

    Automate [Kontena stack variables](https://kontena.io/docs/references/kontena-yml-variables) across deployments.

* `kontena stack validate --online`

    Stack validation happens offline by default, avoiding any side-effects such as Kontena Vault writes.

* `kontena stack upgrade --force`

    Require confirmation if upgrading a different stack file.

* `kontena service show`

   List containers by instance.

* `kontena service rm --instance`

   Force a service instance to be rescheduled.

* `kontena node ssh --any`

    SSH to the first available connected node.

* `kontena node rm`

    Refuse to remove a node that is still online.

* `kontena master user`

    Renamed and deprecated `kontena master users`.

* `kontena volume create`, `show`, `remove`, `list`

    See the [Volumes](https://kontena.io/docs/using-kontena/volumes) documentation.

#### Stacks

* Support named `service: volumes: - volume:/path`

    All [named service volumes](https://www.kontena.io/docs/references/kontena-yml.html#named-volume) must now be defined in the new `volumes` section.

* New `volumes` section

    See the new [Stack Volume Configuration Reference](https://www.kontena.io/docs/references/kontena-yml.html#volume-configuration-reference) documentation.

### Upgrading

#### Upgrading stacks with services using named Docker volumes

Kontena Services could also use named volumes prior to Kontena 1.2, which would implicitly create local Docker volumes on each host node that service instances were deployed to.

After upgrading the server to Kontena 1.2, any such named Docker volumes used by existing services will appear in `kontena volume ls`, in the form of [grid-scoped volumes](https://www.kontena.io/docs/using-kontena/volumes.html#scope-grid) using the default `local` driver. However, trying to install or upgrade a existing stack file containing services that use those named volumes will fail with a validation error: `service ... volumes ...: defines volume name, but file does not contain volumes definitions`

The stack files containing services using named Docker volumes must be edited to use to use the new `volumes` section. The migrated Kontena volumes shown in `kontena volume ls` can be referenced as external volumes in the stack:

```yaml
stack: test/test
services:
  test:
    volumes:
      - test:/test
volumes:
  test:
    external:      # equivalent to `external: true`, matching the name of the volumes section
      name: test
```

After editing the stack file, the stack can be upgraded, and the services can continue to be deployed as before. Assuming the services are using affinity filters such that they continue to be deployed to the same host nodes, then any service containers deployed with Kontena 1.2 will use the existing named local Docker volumes that were implicitly created by earlier Kontena deployments. Using affinity filters to schedule onto specific nodes was already necessary for the stable use of named service volumes in earlier versions of Kontena.

### Known issues

Known regressions in the new Kontena 1.2 release compared to earlier releases.

* Kontena 1.2 cadvisor with rshared bind-mounts is broken on distros running Docker in a non-shared mount namespace #2175

    Service container stats will not be available for host nodes installed using distribution packages that configure the Docker service to run in a separate non-shared mount namespace.

* Stack upgrade / Service update will not re-deploy service on removal of embedded objects (#2109)

    Removing hooks, links, secrets or volumes from a stack service will not re-deploy the service containers after a `kontena stack upgrade`. Use `kontena service deploy --force` to update the service container configuration.
