# Kontena Load Balancer

Load balancers are used to distribute traffic between services. Therefore, having a fully featured, high performance and reliable load balancer is one of the most essential components for building applications composed of multiple services.

With Kontena, developers can enjoy the built-in load balancer that is based on [HAproxy](http://www.haproxy.org/). It is fully managed by Kontena orchestration and enables consistent, portable load balancing on any infrastructure where Kontena Nodes are running.

The Kontena Load Balancer key features:

* Zero downtime when load balancer configuration changes
* Fully automated configuration
* Dynamic routing
* Support for TCP and HTTP traffic
* SSL termination on multiple certificates
* Link certificates from Kontena Vault

## Using Kontena Load Balancer

Kontena Load Balancer is a HAproxy / confd service that is configured to watch changes in etcd. Load Balancers may be described in `kontena.yml` and services are connected automatically by linking services to these load balancer services. If a load balanced service is scaled/re-deployed then the load balancer will reload it's configuration on the fly without dropping connections.

An example of Internet facing load balancer:

```
internet_lb:
  image: kontena/lb:latest
  ports:
    - 80:80

web:
  image: nginx:latest
  environment:
    - KONTENA_LB_MODE=http
    - KONTENA_LB_BALANCE=roundrobin
    - KONTENA_LB_INTERNAL_PORT=80
    - KONTENA_LB_VIRTUAL_HOSTS=www.kontena.io,kontena.io
  links:
    - internet_lb
api:
  image: registry.kontena.local/restapi:latest
  environment:
    - KONTENA_LB_MODE=http
    - KONTENA_LB_BALANCE=roundrobin
    - KONTENA_LB_INTERNAL_PORT=8080
    - KONTENA_LB_VIRTUAL_PATH=/api
  links:
    - internet_lb
```

Always remember to link your service to loadbalancer, the linking activates the loadbalancing functionality.

An example of internal TCP load balancer:

```
galera_lb:
  image: kontena/lb:latest

galera:
  image: registry.kontena.local/galera:latest
  environment:
    - KONTENA_LB_MODE=tcp
    - KONTENA_LB_BALANCE=leastcon
    - KONTENA_LB_EXTERNAL_PORT=3306
    - KONTENA_LB_INTERNAL_PORT=3306
  links:
    - galera_lb
```

## Config Env variables for loadbalancer

These environment variables configure the loadbalancer itself.

* `KONTENA_LB_HEALTH_URI`: uri at which to enable loadbalancer level health check endpoint. Returns `200 OK` when loadbalancer is functional.
* `STATS_PASSWORD`: the password to access stats
* `SSL_CERTS`: SSL certificates to be used, see more: [SSL Termination](loadbalancer#ssl-termination)

## Stats

Kontena loadbalancer exposes statistics web UI only on private overlay network. To access the statistics you must use the [VPN](vpn-access) to access the overlay network. The statistics are exposed on port 1000 on the loadbalancer instances.

## Basic authentication for services

Kontena loadbalancer supports automatic [basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) for balanced services. To enable basic authentication on a given service, use following configuration:
```
version: 2
services:
  internet_lb:
    image: kontena/lb:latest
    ports:
      - 80:80

  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    environment:
      - KONTENA_LB_MODE=http
      - KONTENA_LB_BALANCE=roundrobin
      - KONTENA_LB_INTERNAL_PORT=80
      - KONTENA_LB_VIRTUAL_HOSTS=www.kontena.io,kontena.io
    links:
      - internet_lb
    secrets:
      - secret: BASIC_AUTH_FOR_XYZ
        name: KONTENA_LB_BASIC_AUTH_SECRETS
        type: env

```

To write the configuration in the vault, use following:
```
$ kontena vault write BASIC_AUTH_FOR_XYZ << EOF
→ user user1 password <bcrypt_password>
→ user user2 insecure-password pass1234
→ EOF
```

If you want to use encrypted password note that encrypted passwords are evaluated using the crypt(3) function so different algorithms are supported. For example MD5, SHA-256, SHA-512 are supported. To generate an encrypted password you can use following examples:
```
mkpasswd -m sha-512 passwd
```
Or if your system does not have `mkpasswd` available but you have Docker available, use following:
```
docker run -ti --rm alpine mkpasswd -m sha-512 passwd
```

## SSL Termination

Kontena Load Balancer supports ssl termination on multiple certificates. These certificates can be configured to load balancer by setting the `SSL_CERTS` environment variable. The recommended way to do this is by using Kontena Vault.

The certificate specified in Kontena Load Balancer is a pem file, containing a public certificate followed by a private key (public certificate must be put before the private key, order matters).

You can run the following script to generate a self-signed certificate:

```
$ openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out ca.pem -days 1080 -nodes -subj '/CN=*/O=My Company Name LTD./C=US'
$ cat ca.pem key.pem > cert.pem
```

Once you have the pem file, you can save it to the Kontena Vault:

```
$ kontena vault write my_company_cert "$(cat cert.pem)"
```

And finally you can link the certificate from Vault to your load balancer:

```
loadbalancer:
  image: kontena/lb:latest
  ports:
    - 443:443
  secrets:
    - secret: my_company_cert
      name: SSL_CERTS
      type: env
```


#### An example with 2 certificates (www.domain.com and api.domain.com):

Write certificates to Kontena Vault:

```
$ kontena vault write www_domain_com_cert "$(cat www_domain_com.pem)"
$ kontena vault write api_domain_com_cert "$(cat api_domain_com.pem)"
```
(pem files must contain both a public certificate and a private key)

Map secrets from Vault to lb service:

```
loadbalancer:
  image: kontena/lb:latest
  ports:
    - 443:443
  secrets:
    - secret: www_domain_com_cert
      name: SSL_CERTS
      type: env
    - secret: api_domain_com_cert
      name: SSL_CERTS
      type: env
```

## Config Env variables for balanced services

These options are defined on the services that are balanced through lb.

* `KONTENA_LB_MODE`: mode of load balancing, possible values: http (default), tcp
* `KONTENA_LB_BALANCE`: load balancing algorithm to use, possible values are: roundrobin (default), source, leastcon
* `KONTENA_LB_INTERNAL_PORT`: service port that is attached to load balancer
* `KONTENA_LB_EXTERNAL_PORT`: service port that load balancer starts to listen (only for tcp mode)
* `KONTENA_LB_VIRTUAL_HOSTS`: comma separated list of virtual hosts (only for http mode)
* `KONTENA_LB_VIRTUAL_PATH`: path that is used to match request, example "/api" (only for http mode)
* `KONTENA_LB_KEEP_VIRTUAL_PATH`: if set to true, virtual path will be kept in request path (only for http mode)
* `KONTENA_LB_CUSTOM_SETTINGS`: extra settings, each line will be appended to either related backend section or listen session in the HAProxy configuration file
* `KONTENA_LB_COOKIE`: Enables cookie based session stickyness. With empty value defaults to LB set cookie. Can be customized to utilize application cookies. See details at [HAProxy docs](https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/configuration-1.5.html#4.2-cookie)
