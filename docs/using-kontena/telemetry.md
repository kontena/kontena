# Telemetry

To continuously improve the Kontena experience, the Kontena Master reports anonymous usage data to Kontena, Inc. This data is used to monitor the reliability of Kontena internal components and installations and to find out which features are most popular. This telemetry data is very helpful to us, so we hope that you will leave it enabled.


## Opt-Out

Should you choose to disable Telemetry, you can do so by setting the `server.telemetry_enabled` configuration parameter to `false`. This can be done via the Kontena CLI using following command:

```
$ kontena master config set server.telemetry_enabled=false
```
