# Telemetry

To continuously improve the Kontena experience, Kontena Master reports anonymous usage data to Kontena, Inc. This data is used to monitor the reliability of Kontena internal components, installations and to find out which features are most popular. This telemetry data is very helpful to us, so please leave this enabled.


## Opt-Out

Telemetry can be disabled by setting `server.telemetry_enabled` configuration parameter to `false`. This can be done via Kontena CLI using following command:

```
$ kontena master config set server.telemetry_enabled=false
```
